# __MODULENAME__

(generated from) template repository `pyproject`.

`pyproject` provides a fleshed-out Python package Github repository, which features:
- Sphinx documentation
- poetry settings for building and publishing the package
- github workflow for building the docs on each push

It is currently missing the infrastructure for testing, which may be added in future releases.
